# How to release a Briefcase version

* [Releasing a version](#releasing-a-version)
   * [Releasing a beta version](#releasing-a-beta-version)
* [Post-release considerations](#post-release-considerations)

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/): vx.y.z
  - x represents the *major* version number. Major versions are typically incompatible.
  - y represents the *minor* version number. Minor versions are compatible and have new features.
  - z represents the *patch* version number. Patch versions are only used for bug fixes.

## Releasing a version

0. It's highly recommended you clone the git repo in a different directory to keep the development workspace separate from the release workspace.

1. Go to the [GitHub repo releases page](https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase/releases) and draft a new release

2. Enter the new release version (e.g. `v1.12.0`)

    - Ensure that the selected `Target` branch is `master`
    - Choose a title following the template `ODK Briefcase vx.y.z`
    - Write a description following the template:
    
      ```markdown
      [All changes](https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase/compare/v1...v2)
      
      **Highlights**
      - Some highlighted feature
      - Some highlighted technical improvement
      - Some highlighted bug fix
      - Some important notice about breaking changes
      
      **Added**
      - #123 Title of issue
        - Full name @username
        - Full name @username (Organization)
      
      **Removed**
      - #123 Title of issue
        - Full name @username
      
      **Fixed**
      - #123 Title of issue
        - @username
      ```
      
      Notes:
      - Replace the versions of the `All changes` link with the previous and current tags e.g. `v1.11.3...v.1.12.0`
      - In the `Added`, `Removed`, and `Fixed` sections, always link in this order: Issue > PR > Commit
      - An easy way to get a comprehensive list of these changes is by searching on the `All changes` diff for the terms `Merged` and ` and `. The second term will reveal merges by more than one author which indicate a "squash merge".
      - To make it easy for another person to review the changes, the list of items should be sorted in the same order as they've been closed or merged
    
3. Once the release information has been completed, click on the `Publish release` button.

    GitHub will create a tag from the selected branch
  
4. Go to your release workspace and sync your local repo with `git pull`

    You should see a message telling you about the new tag GitHub has created for your release

5. Check out the tag with `git checkout vx.y.z`. (replace x.y.z with the actual numbers you used in step 2)

    Git should announce that you're on a `detached HEAD`. That's OK.
    
6. Verify that logging, error monitoring, and user tracking have production configurations

   You only have to do this once if you keep a separate release workspace.

   **Logging configuration**
   
   Copy the file at `res/logback.xml.example-release` to `res/logback.xml`
   
   **Error monitoring, and user tracking configuration**
   
   Create the file `gradle.properties` at the root of the project and add these lines:
   
   ```groovy
   sentry.enabled=true
   googleAnalytics.trackingId={TRACKING_ID}  

   ```
   
   Use the Google Analytics tracking ID obtained in the [Google Analytics Dashboard](https://analytics.google.com):
   
   - Select the `ODK Briefcase` app
   - Go to `Admin > (Property section) Property Settings`
   
   Tracking IDs follow the pattern `UA-12345678-1`
     
  
7. Build the release JAR file with `./gradlew clean build`

    The JAR file will be located at `build/libs` and the filename should be like: `ODK-Briefcase-vx.y.z.jar`. (replace x.y.z with the actual numbers you used in step 2)
  
    If your JAR's filename has `-dirty` or any other deviation from the previous template, you've made some mistake while syncing your repo after publishing the release on GitHub.
  
8. Go back to the release at GitHub and edit it. Open a file browser and drag your JAR file into the box. Click on `Update release`.

### Releasing a beta version

- The process is basically the same as with normal version with some small differences:
  - We append the version number with `-beta.N`, replacing `N` with the number of the beta, starting with `0`
  - We check the `This is a pre-release` checkbox to avoid it being linked from https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase/releases/latest
  
## Post-release considerations

- The new release should be linked in Sentry by sending the git refs involved (usually, the last from previous release and the last from the new release).

  The following curl command with take care of this:
  
  ```shell
  curl https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/opendatakit/releases/ \
   -X POST \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer {SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '
   {
     "version": "v1.12.0",
     "refs": [{
         "repository":"opendatakit/briefcase",
         "commit":"{LAST_COMMIT_OF_THIS_RELEASE}",
         "previousCommit":"{LAST_COMMIT_OF_PREVIOUS_RELEASE}"
     }],
     "projects":["briefcase"]
   }
   '
  ```
  
  Replace:
  
  - Sentry auth token, obtained at https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens
  - Last commit of this release, obtained with `git log --pretty=oneline -1`
  - Last commit of the previous release, obtained by checking it out and executing `git log --pretty=oneline -1` 

- There should be a forum post announcing the new release. This post should be on the `Releases` category, or in the `Pre-releases` category if it's a beta pre-release.

  This is an example of a forum post announcing a release:
  
  ```markdown
  **Release highlights**
  * v1.12.0 - Sep 12, 2018

    - New CLI flags:
